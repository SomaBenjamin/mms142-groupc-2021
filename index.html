<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;text-align: center;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">A BRIEF HISTORY ON 3D PRINTING</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">3D printing is a very curious kind of technology. 3D printing uses materials to convert a 3D model or sketch into a 3D object. 3D printing is not one kind of technology, but rather it&rsquo;s an umbrella of similar technologies that can be described using the same term. 3D printing has been thought to be a very recent phenomenon. This isn&rsquo;t true. The concept of 3D printing has existed for a very long time. In science fiction stories from the 40s and 50s, they already had concepts similar to 3D printing. Murray Leinster, in 1945 &nbsp;had an idea for a machine that used melted plastic to form 3D objects from drawing.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The first known idea for 3D printing came in the 70s.In 1971, a patent was created by Johannes F Gottwald for a &ldquo;Liquid Metal Recorder&rdquo;, a device that could &ldquo;print&rdquo; designs on alloys. It did not use liquid ink, but &ldquo;any flowable substance or composition suited for application to the surface for forming symbols, characters, or patterns of intelligence by marking&rdquo;. While this device was never produced in the end, it shows that people had an idea of what the future could look like as early as the 70s.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The earliest record of 3D printing through the additive process was the Japanese inventor Hideo Kodama in 1981. However, he never got to successfully patent this idea, and this idea was never commercialized. This idea was also followed by a trio of French inventors, Jean-Claude Andr&eacute;, Olivier de Witte, and Alain le M&eacute;haut&eacute;, in 1984. However, they were unable to get their financiers on board with the idea, and thus never got to patent it.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">In the U.S, Bill Masters filed a patent for similar technologies, but ultimately abandoned it. Charles &ldquo;Chuck&rdquo; Hull was the first to successfully sell the idea of 3D printing, with the &nbsp;stereolithography system. This process used UV lamps to cure a photosensitive resin layer by layer to create small custom parts. He was able to produce a working 3D printer, the SLA-1, in 1988. Chuck also created the standard of the STL file format and digital slicing process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Other forms of 3D printing such as fused deposition modeling, or FMD, and the SLS, Selective laser sintering, were created during this time. The FDM was patented by Scott Crump, a co-founder of Stratasys, in 1988, but it took until 1992 to be approved. Once it was, he was quick to sell his inventions. Carl Deckard invented SLS, but was heavily limited by the technology of his time.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">At around this time, MIT professor Emanuel Sachs coined the term &ldquo;3D Printing&rdquo;, which meant that the concept known at the time as &ldquo;Rapid Prototyping&rdquo; now had a new name.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">So 3D printers are not recent; what is recent is the cheap implementation of it. Afterall, a form of 3D Printing existed in the 80s, but the cost to buy a 3D printer was expensive, and the materials needed were not widely accessible to many companies. There were also patents in place that prevented widescape production of such materials. Designing models for 3D printing was also hard, as CAD, or computer assisted design, was not widespread until the 2000s. It&rsquo;s thanks to software such as AutoCAD and MicroStation that many 3D printed designs were created. But with all the circumstances lining up, it was in the 2010s that 3D printing boomed.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">3D printing boomed for a multitude of reasons. As mentioned before, software for designing models and patents for creating 3D printers expired. The RepRap Project, which was already making an open source 3D printer in 2005, was a key part of the 3D Printing community. In 2006, when many of the 3D printing patents expired, more and more companies started becoming acquainted with the idea. As patents expired, so did prices, so more commercially produced 3D printers hit the scene.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Another reason was politics. See, Barack Obama mentioned it in his State of the Union speech in 2013. This caused the concept to become more widely known. Companies big and small started investing in the technology, and more and more concepts were able to be produced. Before, 3D printing was mostly used in the medical industry, to help create prosthetics and other kinds of replacement body parts. But now cars, houses, and even food were being 3D printed. This is all thanks to another of the new circumstances. Materials. Before, materials used in 3D printing were liquids, powders, and resins. But now metals, carbon fiber, glass fiber, and even &ldquo;bio-ink&rdquo; are used in 3D printers. Bio-ink has been used for human tissue, and potentially, it can even print human organs for transplants!</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">We are only in the starting years of a revolution in technology. Perhaps someday, there won&rsquo;t be hardware stores anymore. You could go to a 3D printer store to find designs that you need, and have it printed. No need to have expensive parts manufactured in factories, so there will be less pollution in the air too. There&rsquo;s so many ways for 3D Printing to help benefit our lives. The inventors of the future will have quite an exciting time making their inventions!</span></p>
